# FOR RELEASE
#
# [ ] add link to the sourcecode file/folder in the tracker
# [ ] clearify bug report message for expected error to exit exit code and maybe remove 
      error code 3 because its kinda useless. Also mention the use of asserts to make 
      tests actually work
# [ ] maybe exclude logs from change detection?
# [ ] think about bugs with modules again (probably modules folder inside bug folder?)
# [ ] add labels for new and just fixed issues
# [ ] maybe also add -x64 backend
# [ ] think about detecting sb via label instead
# [ ] for issue update in bug suite make rate limit works, for when a new version is released
# [ ] PR template
# [ ] test BB pipeline
      currently problemo, because createTree is failing on forks, even with all permissions...

# [-] making the test run without offline platform? How?
       NOTE: Not directly possible (https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/50926)
             For when its stuck. Its possible to check completely offline though
# [x] update issue template to support is_runtime_test
# [ ] notify me when something changes but passed test was same (compiler output for example)
# [ ] change emailed in handling and add lable for it
# [ ] history (de)compression
# [ ] optional checking if test really crashes on latest version after manual approval
# [ ] create the categoreies list for issue clasification
# [ ] add machine os data etc to issue like windows version, take a look at runner envs
# [ ] fix issue links in readme
